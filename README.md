# Purpose
I'm getting out there into the world, via the internet! I've hopped out of my static home on the side of the highway, and jumped into a ratty old 1994 Ford Dodger, finally on the move, albeit slowly at this stage. 

The purpose of this site is to get me out there, to get eyeballs on the fact that I exist as a developer. A portfolio is necessary and key to getting a job, or even just looked over, in the Development industry. Not to mention, this is literally our job, what we do, if we can't build a great website for ourselves in a capacity for getting hired, then can we really produce a great website for a client? I think not.
